# Rock Paper Scissors (DOM Version)

This is a web-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

The original console-based version has been refactored to feature a visual UI. Players now click on buttons with images to make their choices, and the results are displayed directly on the web page using DOM manipulation — no need to open the console!

---

## Features

- Interactive UI with clickable rock/paper/scissors buttons
- Hover effects using CSS for visual feedback
- Computer randomly selects its move
- Score updates displayed after each round
- Final winner declared after 5 rounds
- Fully handled through DOM manipulation — no console required
